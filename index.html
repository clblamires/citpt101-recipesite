        <p>
            Welcome to my cookbook! This site has all of my favorite recipes in easy-to-follow steps. I love <span class="strike">cookies</span> cooking, and it has become one of my favorite past-times!
        </p>
        <p>
            I began cooking when I was hungry and there was no one around to feed me. At first, I thought I could just eat a bag of doritos and be okay. After all, doritos are orange and I didn't want to get scurvy. I ate the entire bag of doritos, and felt sick immediately. It wasn't scurvy, obviously, because I was eating something orange (is that how that works?), but I think eating a whole bag of doritos may have been bad for me somehow.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next time I was hungry, I decided to try cooking something. I had a microwave and a pack of instant ramen. It was... gross. Next time I was hungry, I wanted to redo the ramen and see what I could do to improve it. I discovered that the stove is <em>not</em> as scary as I once originally thought. Here's a tip for any new chefs out there: <strong>if you're afraid of getting burned by the stove top, don't put your hand on it!</strong> Once I figured that out, a whole new world opened up to me!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I have all sorts of really cool appliances in my kitchen that aren't scary at all!
            <ul>
                <li>Blender</li>
                <li><em>Bigger</em> microwave</li>
                <li>Mixer</li>
                <li>Air fryer</li>
                <li>Pasta maker that I don't actually know how to use</li>
                <li>Electric tea kettle</li>
                <li>And more!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow my recipes and I guarantee that you might or might not make decent food!
