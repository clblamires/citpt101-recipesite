            Here are my favorite recipes. This site will be updated frequently as I figure out how to make more stuff.

            <h2>Fajitas</h2>
            <p>
                You know how most recipe websites start with a long story about how the author prepared the meal, impressed family, and it's just like momma used to make? Here's <em>none of that</em>. Instead, let's just jump right into the recipe!

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Steak or chicken (your choice)</li>
                <li>Bell peppers</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Guacamole</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Pico de gallo</li>
                <li>Corn or flour tortillas</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, cook the meat in a pan so that it is no longer raw and gross. Add bell peppers and onions. If you're like my wife and don't like onions, then put <em>slightly less</em> onions in the pan. I mean, you still want the onions in there. They're good. Just trust me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once this food is almost done cooking, add the tomatoes. Or put the tomatoes on the site. Your choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grab a tortilla and add the meat/veggie mix you just made. Garnish with cheese, guac, and some pico.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put the fajita into your mouth and chew vigorously. Stare at your dinner guests while you eat to assert dominance.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                And don't forget to chew with your mouse closed, otherwise you will look kinda gross.
